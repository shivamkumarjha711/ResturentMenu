Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "RestaurantMenu" project! This project is designed to showcase a user-friendly web application that displays a variety of food items available at a restaurant. Users can easily filter the menu by food item name and food type (breakfast, dinner, lunch, etc.) to find their favorite dishes.

### Tech Stack: 

The project is built using React.js, a powerful and popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It utilizes various packages, including react-dom for rendering components efficiently, and styled-components to ensure a clean and maintainable styling solution.

### Data Source: 

To provide the restaurant menu data, we have integrated an API provided by another person. This API contains a comprehensive list of food items along with their corresponding details such as names, descriptions, prices, and food types. We've implemented the necessary logic to fetch and display this data in an organized manner within the application.

### Key Features:

1.	Interactive User Interface: The application boasts a sleek and user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate through the menu items.
2.	Filter by Name: Users can effortlessly search for specific food items by entering their names in the search bar. The application will instantly filter the menu items accordingly.
3.	Filter by Food Type: To cater to various preferences, users can also filter the menu by selecting food types like breakfast, dinner, lunch, and more. This feature ensures a personalized experience for each user.
4.	Real-time Data: The application fetches data from the external API in real-time, providing users with up-to-date information about the restaurant menu.
